# Features & benefits

The Hugging Face DLCs provide ready-to-use, tested environments to train and deploy Hugging Face models.

## One command is all you need

With the new Hugging Face DLCs, train and deploy cutting-edge Transformers-based NLP models in a single line of code. The Hugging Face PyTorch DLCs for training come with all the libraries installed to run a single command e.g. via TRL CLI to fine-tune LLMs on any setting, either single-GPU, single-node multi-GPU, and more.

## Accelerate machine learning from science to production

In addition to Hugging Face DLCs, we created a first-class Hugging Face library for inference, huggingface-inference-toolkit, that comes with the Hugging Face PyTorch DLCs for inference, with full support on serving any PyTorch model on AWS.

Deploy your trained models for inference with just one more line of code or select any of the ever growing publicly available models from the model Hub.

## High-performance text generation and embedding

Besides the PyTorch-oriented DLCs, Hugging Face also provides high-performance inference for both text generation and embedding models via the Hugging Face DLCs for both Text Generation Inference (TGI) and Text Embeddings Inference (TEI), respectively.

The Hugging Face DLC for TGI enables you to deploy any of the +225,000 text generation inference supported models from the Hugging Face Hub, or any custom model as long as its architecture is supported within TGI.

The Hugging Face DLC for TEI enables you to deploy any of the +12,000 embedding, re-ranking or sequence classification supported models from the Hugging Face Hub, or any custom model as long as its architecture is supported within TEI.

Additionally, these DLCs come with full support for AWS meaning that deploying models from Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is also straight forward and requires no configuration.

## Built-in performance

Hugging Face DLCs feature built-in performance optimizations for PyTorch to train models faster. The DLCs also give you the flexibility to choose a training infrastructure that best aligns with the price/performance ratio for your workload.

Hugging Face Inference DLCs provide you with production-ready endpoints that scale quickly with your Google Cloud environment, built-in monitoring, and a ton of enterprise features.
