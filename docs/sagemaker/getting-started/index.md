# Hugging Face on AWS

Hugging Face partners with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to democratize artificial intelligence (AI), enabling developers to seamlessly build, train, and deploy state-of-the-art machine learning models using AWS's robust cloud infrastructure. â€‹

This collaboration aims to offer developers access to an everyday growing catalog of pre-trained models and dataset from the Hugging Face Hub, using Hugging Face open-source libraries across a broad spectrum of AWS services and hardware platforms.

We build new experiences for developers to seamlessly train and deploy Hugging Face models whether they use AWS AI platforms such as Amazon SageMaker AI and AWS Bedrock, or AWS Compute services such as Elastic Container Service (ECS), Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), and virtual servers on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).

We develop new tools to simplify the adoption of custom AI accelerators like AWS Inferentia and AWS Trainium, designed to enhance the performance and cost-efficiency of machine learning workloads.

By combining Hugging Face's open-source models and libraries with AWS's scalable and secure cloud services, developers can more easily and affordably incorporate advanced AI capabilities into their applications.
